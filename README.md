### Network reducer
A network reducer to be provided to the store.

#### Usage

##### 1.- Give the network reducer to Redux
```js
// configureStore.js
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux'
import { reducer as irc } from 'react-irc';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  // ... your other reducers here ...
  irc,
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer);
export default store;
```

### Inspiration
Thanks to Martyn Smith for his awesome project [Node IRC](https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc), which served me as inspiration for the react irc implementation.
